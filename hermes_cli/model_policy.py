"""Fleet model policy — allowlist enforcement at agent spawn.

HAA ruling 2026-08-04 (binding), issued after the $98/hr burn incident:

  1. Nothing that MONITORS may run above the monitor ceiling.
  2. No agent or process may use anything but a DEFINED model.
     An undefined model is not a fallback — it is a request that
     requires approval.

This module is the single choke point.  ``enforce()`` is called from
``cli_agent_setup_mixin`` where the effective model is resolved, so
every spawn path (kanban dispatch, cron, CLI, gateway) that builds via
HermesCLI passes through it.

Policy lives in ``~/.hermes/model_policy.yaml`` so it is auditable and
editable without a code change.  A missing policy file fails OPEN with
a warning (never brick the fleet on a missing config); a malformed
entry fails CLOSED for that profile.

HEL-6107 re-land (narrow): rules 1–3 only.  ADR-0024 §3/§4 task-shape
free-on-build is NOT enforced here — that stays on kanban pins + MODEL-004.
